I am one of the founding members of Robostorm and have held many officer positions. I have also done many robotics projects on my own and have significant experience with 3D printing. I created this FTC team because the FRC teams I have been on in the past have been too large for my liking. I have gained significant leadership experience with Robostorm, and I wanted to take it further with an FTC team. I also use linux on a daily basis and play Alto Sax for the high school band.  My leadership role on our team is co-captain.</p>

I’ve been a member of the 4H Robostorm Club for 4 years. I joined the FTC team because I felt that It would be a big step up from FLL, and I would get a lot of coding experience and get better at working with others in my club. My hobbies are circuit board design, 3D printing, designing 3D models, and building things. Also, I am a Star Scout, Patrol Leader, and Webmaster in Boy Scouts Troop 43 in Princeton.

I was in a previous robotics club for 1 year, but then our club only had 2 members, so we merged into Robostorm. I am very interested in computer science and robotics. I am very eager to learn more in robotics, which is the reason why I joined the FTC team. Currently I attend the CSSEA (Computer Science and Software Engineering Academy) which runs out of Delaware Valley Regional High School District. This program currently selects only 23 people in the whole county who have gone through the application process, taken an interview, and a test. Using the skills I learn in the CSSEA and FTC I hope I will be able to gain more knowledge and better myself in computer science and robotics. My leadership role on our team is judging.</p>

            <p class="mb-3">My name is Mike Rowe. I'm a 10th grader at Hunterdon Central. In 8th grade I participated in a solar car race challenge which required me to build a small “toy” car that runs off of solar energy. Most built it out of wood and hot glue, I designed mine using CAD software (tinkercad) and 3D printed it so it was extra light and durable. In 9th grade I took a robotics class to learn more about the design process and problem solving. In that class I designed and made different robots to complete various challenges while documenting every step of the way. I joined the 4H Robostorm club in 4th grade. I was glad that Andrew decided to form the team because I feel that the high school team this year became too crowded and not a good learning environment. By founding our own team I already know the people on the team and it's less crowded meaning a more individualised learning experience. My hobbies are robotics, Boy Scouts, singing, dancing/partying, video games, and playing various strategy board games.  My leadership role on our team is scouting.</p>

I started the LEGO Robotics Club at my school after being a parent volunteer in 2015-2016 with FLL Team 16130. I wanted to be a coach for FTC Team 12601 because I think experiences like FIRST Tech Challenge are beneficial to teens on so many levels: building, programming, working with a team, and communicating their ideas to teammates, judges, and the community.</p>

I will mentor the rookie team members by demonstrating engineering principles, getting members to think outside of the box and strongly emphasize working to a timeline with enough time left to troubleshoot problems and work on driving skills.</p>

Growing up, my hobbies were anything involving building, from LEGOs to remote control vehicles (cars, trucks, helicopters, boats, and planes) to automobiles.  My experience with FIRST began immediately after graduation from college in 1992 when he was hired by his alma mater to coach the WPI/Mass Academy US FIRST team (now FRC) for 3 seasons.  The experience was his first in competitive robotics, and he enjoyed the challenge and camaraderie.   2015-2016 he volunteered with FLL Team 16130 and in 2016-2017 he mentored the FRC Team 3637. It was interesting  to see how FIRST has changed and stayed the same over the 20+ years since my first participation. I am excited to mentor FTC Team 12601 this year.</p>

I decided to become a Mentor because I believe that STEM Education is one of the most important tools all of our students can learn, not just for schoolwork, but for their careers and for life.  The FIRST Robotics team is one of the best places to not only learn everything about STEM, but to learn life’s lessons...such as teamwork, lots of practical skills, hard work, and professionalism... all while having fun!
